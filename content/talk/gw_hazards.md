abstract_short = "In this two-part talk, I will first present research to understand how exploitation of a multi-aquifer system in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam affects naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater.  Synthesis of field work, existing remotely sensed and ground-based datasets, and numerical modeling led us to propose a new contamination mechanism, that may be important in similar systems around the world. In the second part, I will discuss a portfolio of projects that I work on at the EPA, many of which are concerned with nitrogen in groundwater.  Fertilizers in the Willamette Valley, OR and septic systems on Cape Cod, MA, among other sources and places, have left decades of contamination belowground.   Remedies for non-point source pollution are necessarily cooperative and call for, among many other actions, open and interdisciplinary research. I’m using methods that support reproducibility and collaboration (e.g., R, GitHub) to enhance the way we work on complex teams and problems.  I will share some such workflows and outcomes."
